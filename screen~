screen- terminal multiplexer
screen program allows you to use multiple windows (virtual VT100 terminals) in Unix
you can use screen to keep programs running after you accidentally close the terminal emulator, or even after you log out, and later resume right where you were.

Every program running under screen runs in a window, and every window is identified by a unique number. Screen made a new window, numbered it 0, and started a command shell inside it. 


screen -ls                     to list no of screens in the system
screen -r 2233/name
   (single user)
   screen -x 2233/name
   (multiple  user cn use)        to get back to the screen identified by a number/name
screen -S name                  to name screen while creating it
screen -x                      list existing screens
screen -x name                 to get into that screen

ctrl-a d                       to get out of( close) the screen without killing it
ctrl-a shift c                 make new window
ctrl-a shift a                 to name a new window
ctrl-a shift "                 shift window
ctrl-a shift p                 previous window
ctrl-a shift n                 next window
ctrl-a shift 0-9               to shift to window numbered 0-9
ctrl-a k                       kill curent window
ctrl-a D D                     detach and logout
